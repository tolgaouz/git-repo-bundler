# Polymet Github Repository Bundler

This is a non-functional proof of concept for a tool that bundles a given Github repositories UI componenets to be used with the Polymet App.

## Possible Fixes

- I was able to get a bundle for the https://github.com/vercel/ai-chatbot/blob/main/components/ui/button.tsx before wrapping this up in a server. Seems like
resolving the imports and aliases manually can be a bit overkill.
